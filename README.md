# Superpowers-Vue

Superpowers-Vue is a fork of [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) adapted for Vue.js projects. It adds integrated UI design intelligence (ui-ux-pro-max) to the brainstorming workflow, with Vue/Vite/Vitest as the default stack.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Register the marketplace (from GitHub)
claude plugin marketplace add Jad2wizard/superpowers

# Install superpowers-vue
claude plugin install superpowers-vue@superpowers-vue-marketplace

# Install required dependency
claude plugin install ui-ux-pro-max@ui-ux-pro-max-skill
```

Or via local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jad2wizard/superpowers.git
cd superpowers
./install.sh --scope user
```

## How it works

Same as Superpowers, plus:

- **Brainstorming Step 6**: When working on visual/UI projects, brainstorming auto-triggers ui-ux-pro-max to generate design tokens and HTML mockups before writing the spec.
- **Vue-first defaults**: `--stack vue` is the default for all ui-ux-pro-max CLI calls.

Without this plugin, brainstorming will skip UI mockup generation for visual projects.

### Codex CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Superpowers:

  ```bash
  superpowers
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Codex App

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Superpowers` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Superpowers and follow the prompts.

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install superpowers@superpowers
  ```

### Gemini CLI

- Install the extension:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/obra/superpowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions update superpowers
  ```

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Superpowers separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin superpowers
  ```

- Or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  ```

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** - Activates before writing code. Refines rough ideas through questions, explores alternatives, presents design in sections for validation. Saves design document.

2. **using-git-worktrees** - Activates after design approval. Creates isolated workspace on new branch, runs project setup, verifies clean test baseline.

3. **writing-plans** - Activates with approved design. Breaks work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each). Every task has exact file paths, complete code, verification steps.

4. **subagent-driven-development** or **executing-plans** - Activates with plan. Dispatches fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints.

5. **test-driven-development** - Activates during implementation. Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR: write failing test, watch it fail, write minimal code, watch it pass, commit. Deletes code written before tests.

6. **requesting-code-review** - Activates between tasks. Reviews against plan, reports issues by severity. Critical issues block progress.

7. **finishing-a-development-branch** - Activates when tasks complete. Verifies tests, presents options (merge/PR/keep/discard), cleans up worktree.

**The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.** Mandatory workflows, not suggestions.

## What's Inside

### Skills Library

**Testing**
- **test-driven-development** - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle (includes testing anti-patterns reference)

**Debugging**
- **systematic-debugging** - 4-phase root cause process (includes root-cause-tracing, defense-in-depth, condition-based-waiting techniques)
- **verification-before-completion** - Ensure it's actually fixed

**Collaboration** 
- **brainstorming** - Socratic design refinement
- **writing-plans** - Detailed implementation plans
- **executing-plans** - Batch execution with checkpoints
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** - Concurrent subagent workflows
- **requesting-code-review** - Pre-review checklist
- **receiving-code-review** - Responding to feedback
- **using-git-worktrees** - Parallel development branches
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Merge/PR decision workflow
- **subagent-driven-development** - Fast iteration with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)

**Meta**
- **writing-skills** - Create new skills following best practices (includes testing methodology)
- **using-superpowers** - Introduction to the skills system

## Philosophy

- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, always
- **Systematic over ad-hoc** - Process over guessing
- **Complexity reduction** - Simplicity as primary goal
- **Evidence over claims** - Verify before declaring success

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support.

1. Fork the repository
2. Switch to the 'dev' branch
3. Create a branch for your work
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, being sure to fill in the pull request template.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.
